<p><div class="pets"> <h4>BIRDS</h4> Choosing a bird as your pet can be very rewarding. Owning a pet bird can be a wonderful experience but birds are not the best pet for everyone. There are many different types of birds to choose from. It is very important to choose the right bird to fit into your lifestyle. Hand-raised babies make the best pets. Birds are intelligent, entertaining and active. Some are playful and affectionate. They will not be happy if placed in a secluded part of the house and ignored.</p>
